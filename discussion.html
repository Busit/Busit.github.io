<a name="rest"><h2 onclick="return; $(this).next().slideToggle(500);">Rest API</h2></a>
<div class="answer">
	<p class="you_say">Why doesn't the REST API use HTTP headers and return code like everyone else ?</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">ISO Model</a> defines the different layers required to obtain communication between parties.
		The model is divided in 7 layers from hardware to application. The entire principle is that higher order layers should not care about lower ones and
		consider that it is being taken care of. Hence, when you send an email using SMTP, you do not need to know how to calibrate the electric pulse of the
		wireless connection.</p>
	<p class="we_say">Why only 7 layers ?</p>
	<p>Because this is a normative reference. Thereof, everything else is beyond (or encapsulated in) the 7th layer and thus considered application-specific which is outside the scope
		of the norm. The <strong>HTTP</strong> transport protocol is considered as <strong>layer 7</strong>.</p>
	<p class="we_say">But HTTP is just a transport layer !</p>
	<p>Indeed, you can exchange many different types of things using HTTP, starting with HTML. And indeed,
		according to the encapsulation principle of the ISO model, the HTML page you see does not care about whether or not you have some HTTP-specific 
		things going on. The article you read will be the same regardless of the compression algotithm used by the server to transfer HTTP packets.</p>
	<p class="we_say">REST API is layer 8</p>
	<p>Therefore, we consider that the REST API lies in an 8th layer <strong>on top of HTTP</strong>.
		And according to the ISO encapsulation, we should not rely on a lower level specifics: the HTTP headers, the HTTP response code or the HTTP encoding,...</p>
	<p>The REST API speaks JSON and this is what matters.</p>
	<p class="you_say">So is the entire world wrong and you are right ?</p>
	<p>There is no right or wrong. If ever there is an evolution of the HTTP protocol, the Busit REST API will remain untouched whereas other implementations
		will most probably need deep adjustments to make it compliant to another version... which may latter change again...</p>

<a name="md5"><h2 onclick="return; $(this).next().slideToggle(500);">MD5</h2></a>
<div class="answer">
	<p class="you_say">Why do tokens and passwords use MD5 whereas it has been proven to be a compromized algorithm ?</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> hashing algorithm is used to issue API tokens and to hash passwords.
		This is an educated choice for the purposes it serves. You may have read or heard that MD5 is compromized or weak or else, 
		which is entirely true. However, this does not remove the intresic propreties of the algorithm per-se that we are interrested in:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>It hashes one way so that you cannot retreive the original input from the hash, <strong>this still holds</strong>.</li>
		<li>It is fast and broadly supported, from databases to programming languages, <strong>this still holds</strong>.</li>
		<li>It produces hashes with a probability sufficiently close to a uniform distribution, <strong>this still holds</strong>.</li>
		<li>It is 128bit long, which is 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 possibilities, <strong>this still holds</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="we_say">But why is it compromized then ?</p>
	<p>Some researchers have found a way to produce collision attacks (with 11 hours of processing using an entire data center) which means that they were
		able to forge two different files that give the same hash output.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the case of tokens, the only component retained is the randomness, not the meaning of the hash. Thus it does not matter at all whether or not the
		hashing algorithm is compromized.</li>
		<li>In the case of passwords, we are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching">key stretching</a> in which case, finding the original 
		input is not less computationally hard than brute force. Once again, the collision weakness of the algorithm does not alter the complexity of retreiving
		the original password.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="we_say">How does one find your password based on the MD5 hash ?</p>
	<p>There are two ways to find the password based on the MD5 hash. Those are the same two methods than for any other hashing algorithm:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Rainbow tables</strong>. This means that people keep a list of all possible hash with the corresponding input value. Then you just
			have to select the hash in the list and that's it, you have it ! However, this requires a list of 2e128 entries of 128bit each, which is about
			3.9e28 TB of storage, just for the hash, then you have to store the values too. However, beware that partial rainbow
			tables do exist, with the most common words or phrases. So if you use a weak password, it is probably listed already.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Brute force</strong>. This means that people try all possible combinations until they find a match. Depending on the complexity of your 
			password, it may be easier to bruteforce the hash itself than the password, i.e. if your password is longer than 32 characters with random binary.
			Otherwise, if you use lower case and upper case letters, numbers and about 15 special characters, if your password is 10 characters long, this is only 
			7.3e18 possibilities. So basically, it is by far much more faster to brute force your password than the hash, MD5 or not.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="you_say">Are you saying MD5 is safe ?</p>
	<p>No. Security is a serious topic, and we take it very seriously. However, lets not confuse what we want to acheive and how to acheive it.
		Some people will havoc MD5 because it is flawed. We rather use it for what it is good at.

<a name="json"><h2 onclick="return; $(this).next().slideToggle(500);">JSON</h2></a>
<div class="answer">
	<p class="you_say">Why did you reinvent the wheel with your own JSON parser ?</p>
	<p>The short answer is because we are actually using our platform ourselves and we find it much more convenient that way.</p>
	<p>
		The long answer is a matter of where you need JSON and how fast, robust or convenient you want it to be. We created a custom JSON parser to
		read data, but writing JSON is done in a strict conventionnal manner. That way, we send valid JSON to external sources, but if we receive somewhat
		malformed input, we try our best to understand it.
	</p>
	<p>The platform is using different programming languages at different levels. The API is written in Java, the frontend is using Javascript, and BusApps may use PHP.
		All those do support JSON, and all those also have a different natural way to write data.
	</p>
<pre><code class="java">
// JAVA
Map&lt;String, Object> = new HashMap&lt;String, Object>() { {"key1", "value"}, {"key2", 42} };
List&lt;Object> = new ArrayList&lt;Object>() { "value", 42 };
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="javascript">
// JAVASCRIPT
var map = { 'key1': "value", 'key2': 42 };
var list = [ "value", 42 ];
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="php">
// PHP
$map = [ "key1" => 'value', "key2" => 42 ];
$list = [ 'value', 42 ];
</code></pre>
	<p>Some languages are more strict while some other are more loose. For instance, Javascript does not care about a single trailing coma while PHP is very strict
		about it. But in the end, this is all about conforming human developers to yet another syntax. So we turned things around and asked ourselves about whether
		or not <strong>the language should adapt to the developer</strong> instead !
	</p>
	<p>In the three example above, <i>-- provided that you are a developer that knows about JSON --</i>, you were certainly able to understand what the code meant even if you
		did not know that particular programming language. As a developer again, you most probably encountered this type of error: 
		<code>Missing semicolon ';' on line 42 at character 666.</code> or something like 
		<code>Found ')' on line 42 at character 666 but expecting '}'.</code> 
		Then you most probably thought out loud <i>"But do it then if you know it, you #@$*"</i>
	</p>
	<p>Well, this is exactly what we do. If 2 different human can understand what was meant in the JSON, so should the parser. Knowing JSON, can you guess what was meant
		here ?
	</p>
<pre>
{ 'key1': "value", key2: 42 }

{ "key1" => "value", "key2" 42
</pre>
	<p class="we_say">And can your parser tell what this meant ?<br /><code>[ 42: "123,key' value; [ '}', value-:</code></p>
	<p>Well, can you ? The goal is not to be challenged on the most complicated scenarios just to make the point. The goal is to <strong>simplify developer's life</strong>
	by accepting common mistakes. Some languages accept single or double quotes, we do. Some languages accept trailing coma or missing semicolon, we do. 
	Some languages use colon or arrows, we do. And so on.</p>
	
	<p class="we_say">And what about performance ?</p>
	<p>There are numerous aspects on performance that should be taken into account. Decoding speed, CPU hunger, memory footprint, warmup phases,... and those do not
		apply equally for huge JSON as for tiny JSON. So considering that the main purpose of our JSON parser is to understand the BusApp config file, this is about
		a few kilobytes a few times a day, the fastest library out there takes about 2.5ms to process the file, and our parser is about 100% slower with a very bad 
		5ms. This means that we are spoiling 6ms of processing everyday. In this case, the tradeoff is very clear and this is a sacrifice on performance we are willing
		to make.
	</p>
	
	<p class="you_say">So you pretend your parser is better ?</p>
	<p>The notion of good or bad is subjective. Our parser fit our needs, is easy to use and holds in a single code file 
		(compared to 750 files for the Jackson library). Did we really need it, as we said first, we are the first users of our plaform, we are human, 
		and we do mistakes. So our parser saves us hours of debugging every day.
